This project was started as a group project for my introduction to software engineering class. The original project is in this repo for you to check out: https://github.com/Sarah-Shahinpour/CS411

Our idea was to use the Spotify api to enable users to find songs and add it to their playlist, and while our original project contains the main essence of our goal, some part of the project was rushed or ignored in order to finish in time.
My idea was to improve the project since we didn't really get to finish it and some of the code is hardcoded. My goal is to not only integrate my own ideas into the project, but also to fix some of the problems we faced. I'll keep an update log and try to implement all the ideas I have.

What the app will do?
The application will allow users to login to Spotify and obtain an access token for our web app to use. Afterward, the user can create a playlist based on their personal favorites on Spotify or they could use the custom option to create a playlist based on the settings they selected. 

Note: one requirement for the project was that we needed a front-end and back-end, we selected to use React.js on the front-end and Express.js on the back-end. This project can easily be done on just one framework, but doing it this way helped us learn about the RESTful interface and I'll be continuely using api calls between the two ends.

Please be mindful that this project is not complete, and I am merely pushing my most updated versions onto Github whenever I work on it. I'll be keeping an update log and focus on writing meaningful commits in order to practice good software development merits.
