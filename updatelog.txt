5/28: Created github repo and pushed the original files that I have on my computer to it, this version contains the code that I last worked on before passing it to my groupmates to finish on the front-end.

6/3: Installed the latest updates for the node.js dependencies used in the project. NOTE, I realized that request is a depreciated node.js dependency and it is definitely something I can change, however, I would rather add the additional changes I wanted before refactoring and fixing something that isn't broken.

6/6: Added a login interface where it requires the user to either login to Spotify if he/she does not have an account in the app or login using an account in the app. Login using an account in the app does not require the user to login to Spotify. Also added some requirements for creating a valid username, a problem occured when a username has space in it, now the username cannot contain space or other special characters. Also added a sign out and delete account option for the user once they have login using an account in the app.
